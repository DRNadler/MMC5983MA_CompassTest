Three are several different ZIPs on the Microchip site.
They seem to correspond to different versions of Visual Studio.

Most recent version is for Visual Studio 2015.
It includes:
- a LIB version (all driver interface code is within the LIB)
- a DLL version (the LIB contains only the thunks to invoke the DLL)
These appear to be release builds only.

The ONLY build success (in early 2021 tests) was with:
- Release, x86
- DLL version from Microchip
