Version numbers are blank in DLLs, and no version labels are evident.

Three are several different ZIPs on the Microchip site.
They seem to correspond to different versions of Visual Studio.

Most recent version is for Visual Studio 2015.
It includes:
- a LIB version (all driver interface code is within the LIB)
- a DLL version (the LIB contains only the thunks to invoke the DLL)
These appear to be release builds only.
